        <p id="donate-plan-mainp">First,we focus on basic human rights.That includes food,<br>clothes and education for
            helpless people.</p>

                <h2>Food for a family</h2>
                <p>Living on the poverty line is not only associated with poor economy, but with
                    other problems such as
                    nutrition-related illnesses.</p>

                <h2>Shelter for a family</h2>
                <p>Shelters are important because they keep people from harm. Shelters give people a feeling of
                    well-being and boost their will to live. Having a shelter is also a basic human necessity, in
                    addition to food and water.</p>

                <h2>Education for a child</h2>
                <p>Education Is a Necessity: Poor Students Deserve Equal Opportunity for Higher Education. Many young
                    people dream about having successful careers as lawyers, doctors, or CEO's of major corporations,
                    but to achieve these goals they must be adequately educated. However, not all people are given the
                    same opportunities as others.</p>
